          <h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
          <p>
            Did you find freeCodeCamp because your New Year's resolution is to
            learn to code? FreeCodeCamp San Francisco is excited to welcome you!
            We're a group of self-taught coders who are helping each other along
            the way and we're glad you're joining us. Due to Covid-19 all of our
            meet ups are currently online and much of our conversations happen
            on Slack, so it's the perfect time to join us no matter where you
            are. This page is a guide with a our favorite resources and advice
            to get you started on your journey. Coding can be tough, but it's
            easier when you have a community.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find many guides online on how to get started and how to
            structure your learning journey and it can quickly get overwhelming.
            Our go to advice is to start with the first certificate of the
            freeCodeCamp curriculum,
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn"
              >responsive web development</a
            >
            where you will learn the basics of HTML and CSS to build your first
            webpage. It's a great introduction to web development. You can also
            browse our <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> section to get answers to some
            questions you might have. We're also working on goal specific
            learning tracks so check back with us soon!
          </p>
          <p>
            We also recommend that you involve yourself in a social coding
            community like freeCodeCamp San Francisco. You will be surprised how
            much you learn by hearing people at other experience levels talk
            about coding and you'll also have the chance to ask questions about
            something you get stuck on. Learning to teach yourself to code can
            be a lonely experience but it doesn't have to be. Most of our group
            members have been exactly where you are now so we compiled a list of
            the resources that we have personally used and recommend the most
            often. These resources focus primarily on full stack web development
            since that is what most of us have studied. We hope these resources
            help you on your journey as well.
